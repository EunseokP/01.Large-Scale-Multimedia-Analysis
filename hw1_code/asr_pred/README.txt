There are 2 kinds of files.
$Event_name in (P001, P002, P003)
$Feature_type in (mfcc, asr)
1. {$Event_name}_{$Feature_type}.list : It contains only scores for event
2. {$Event_name}_{$Feature_type}.list.video: It contains video_id and scores

I am not sure which format of file will be working on test environment.
So, I prepare 2 kinds of files for both every event and feature type.
Please choose one of two files properly.

Thank you for your consideration in advance.
